# UCB-ELT-Project

In this project I extracted, transformed, and loaded data. The data was extracted from Wikipedia and Kaggle. Once the data is cleaned, the Wikipedia and Kaggle Movies datasets are merged into one dataset. The ratings dataset is kept apart. The newly transformed datasets are then loaded into SQL database for further analysis.
